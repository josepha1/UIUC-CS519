Telea (accessible through UIUC Library sign-in at [this page](https://i-share-uiu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99944517012205899&context=L&vid=01CARLI_UIU:CARLI_UIU&tab=LibraryCatalog&lang=en)) or the Wikipedia page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral_convolution for additional overviews of the algorithm.\n",

    "LIC takes as input a noisy image or texture defined over the domain of the vector field we want to visualize and outputs an image that is blurred along the streamlines of the vector field. We will thus need to trace the streamlines for every pixel in the texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do so, let's first define and implement a function `advance` that will advance from one pixel to another in the direction of the vector associated with a given pixel within the vector field. This function should take 8 parameters:\n",
    "- `x` and `y` indicate the coordinates of the pixel we're currently on. \n",
    "- `ux` and `uy` indicate the x and y components of the vector at the current pixel\n",
    "- `fx` and `fy` indicate the current subpixel position (treating the current pixel as a unit square where `(0,0)` represents the top-left of the pixel, while `(1,1)` represents the bottom-right of the pixel).\n",
    "- `nx` and `ny` indicate the total number of pixels along the x and y axes within the domain of the entire vector field.\n",
    "\n",
    "`advance()` should return a 4-tuple consisting of updated `x`, `y`, `fx`, and `fy` values. These values should be updated by:\n",
    "  1. reading the current pixel / subpixel position given by `x`, `y`, `fx`, and `fy`\n",
    "  2. calculating `tx` and `ty` as the time it takes to reach the next pixel along each axis given `fx`, `fy`, `ux` and `uy`\n",
    "  3. determining whether the next pixel reached will be on the x-axis or on the y-axis, and whether we are moving forward or backward along that axis\n",
    "  4. using `tx`, `ty`, `ux`, `uy`, and the results of step (3) to update `x`, `y`, `fx`, and `fy` in the same order we cross pixel boundaries after `min(tx,ty)` units of time (i.e., advance far enough to cross a pixel boundary and no farther)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your implementation should also handle the two special cases where `advance()` would return a pixel outside the vector field, or where `ux` and `uy` are both zero vectors. In the first case, `x` and `y` should just be clamped to the boundaries of the vector field. In the second case, you could actually interpolate the vector field value at that pixel, but for the purpose of this assignment, you can just return `None`. **Rounding should not be needed or used within your implementation**."
